# Welcome to the Free Online Scrum Master README!

Our objective is to promote asynchronous development with fewer and more efficient meetings.

We seek to exercise and flesh out our asynchronous proccess throughout the SDLC of this open-source tool!

## Running in development mode

1) `git clone https://github.com/mj-the-destroyer/free-online-scrum-master.git`
2) `cd free-online-scrum-master`
3) `npm i`
3) `npm run start-dev`

UI should now be at `http://localhost:4200/` and API at `http://localhost:3000/`. Both should reload if you make any changes to the source code.

## Building and deploying the project

After changes have been merged into `master` branch.

1) `git clone https://github.com/mj-the-destroyer/free-online-scrum-master.git`
2) `cd free-online-scrum-master`
3) `git checkout master`
3) `git pull`
3) `git push heroku master`

(Only Wil can deploy to production b/c we are using his heroku account)
